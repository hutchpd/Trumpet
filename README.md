# Trumpet Trainer (MVP)

A small fun project to help with practicing the trumpet. It uses MIDI playback, a visual note highway, and optional microphone pitch detection to provide feedback while playing along.

## Features

* Upload and play MIDI files.
* Visual note highway with trumpet valve mapping.
* Adjustable tempo (BPM).
* Real-time stats on hits and misses.
* Optional microphone pitch feedback.

## Tech Stack

* React (via in-browser JSX with Babel)
* Tone.js for audio
* @tonejs/midi for MIDI parsing
* VexFlow for score rendering
* TailwindCSS for styling

## Getting Started

Just open the HTML file in a modern browser (Chrome recommended). Upload a MIDI file, press play, and practice!
